# Welcome to Falco I - Introduction to Runtime Security

In this scenario, you will learn the fundamentals of Falco, a runtime security monitoring tool for Linux systems.

## What is Falco?

Falco is an open-source runtime security tool that monitors your Linux system and detects unexpected behavior, intrusions, and data theft in real-time. It works by:

- **Monitoring system calls** using eBPF or kernel modules
- **Analyzing file access and process activity** for suspicious behavior  
- **Providing real-time alerts** when security rules are violated
- **Running as a userspace program** that can integrate with various systems

## What you'll learn:

1. **Install Falco** on a Linux system using package managers
2. **Understand Falco rules** and how they detect threats
3. **Generate and observe security alerts** from suspicious activities

## Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Linux systems
- Understanding of command line operations
- Familiarity with file permissions and processes

Let's get started with securing your system runtime!
